# OpenSensorHub SensorThings Overview

A new **OpenSensorHub service** module implementing **OGC SensorThings API** (STA) has been developed during this project. The implementation is part of the OSH v2.0 development cycle, and  based on Fraunhofer's open source [FROST-Server](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server) with completely different persistence and message bus layers that allow full integration with OSH.

Source code, documentation and more details about the implementation are available in [branch 'v2' of the osh-addons GitHub repository](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-addons/tree/v2/services/sensorhub-service-sensorthings). The code is available under [Mozilla Public License v2.0](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0).

Detailed progress on the implementation of various STA features are tracked in this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-addons/issues/12).

A [Tester Page](https://opensensorhub.github.io/project-scira/sensorthings/tester) is also available so that other testbed participants can easily provide feedback on the implementation.

Please provide all feedback regarding this specific service on the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-addons/issues) for the **osh-addons** project.
