### Lagrangian Plume Model

OSH Adaptor supporting the University of Alabama in Huntsville Lagrangian plume model which predicts smoke/aerosol plume distribution using a Lagrangian particle model. Supports the tasking/execution of the model (given a location and other parameters) and the access to the predicted results (essentially particle locations with time).
