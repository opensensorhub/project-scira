SensorML Library (lib-sensorml)
===============================

This project aims at building a JAVA API and implementation of a SensorML based Processing Engine.
The engine itself is decoupled from SensorML but the project also provides serializers and deserializers 
to instantiate a Process Chain from a SensorML file or save a process chain in SensorML format.

The processing engine implementation is particularly oriented toward real time stream processing and
distributed pipelined processing. The development of executable process model profiles is supported by the
development project at SensorML Profile Development.

The project was initiated by the [VAST Team](http://vast.uah.edu) at the [University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH)](http://www.uah.edu) and is now maintained by [Sensia Software](http://www.sensiasoftware.com) and [Botts Innovative Research, Inc](http://www.botts-inc.com).

This project relies on the [SWE Common Library](https://github.com/sensiasoft/lib-swe-common).
