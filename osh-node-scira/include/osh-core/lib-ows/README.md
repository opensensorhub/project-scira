OWS Library (lib-ows)
=====================

This project aims at building a JAVA API and implementation for OGC Web Services. It focuses on Sensor Web Enablement Services in particular such as the Sensor Observation Service, Sensor Planning Service but also includes some fairly advanced serializers/deserializers for the Web Coverage Service.

The project was initiated by the [VAST Team](http://vast.uah.edu) at the [University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH)](http://www.uah.edu) and is now maintained by [Sensia Software](http://www.sensiasoftware.com) and [Botts Innovative Research, Inc](http://www.botts-inc.com).

This project relies on the [SWE Common Library](https://github.com/sensiasoft/lib-swe-common).
